#StackOverflow Analysis

The StackOverflow dataset can be used to gain some valuable insight into the users and communities that live on the platform, as well as insight into the posts themselves. The dataset is in XML format and there exists a number of good Java XML parsing libraries that can be used to read in all the data and construct Map-Reduce jobs for analysis.

The goal of the project is to analyse the dataset of StackOverflow portal in terms of revealing relation of users on the base of comments, questions and answers and creating graph on the base of this information.
